Distribution layer for Dynamic Devices Edge Computing platforms, providing custom Linux microPlatform (LmP) distributions with specialized features and configurations.

## Overview

This layer provides distribution configurations that extend the standard Linux microPlatform (LmP) with Dynamic Devices-specific features:

- **Security-focused configurations** - Disabled zeroconf, enhanced security policies
- **Device auto-registration** - Automatic device onboarding and management
- **Platform-specific optimizations** - Audio, connectivity, and power management features
- **Commercial license support** - For proprietary components and applications
- **Multiple distribution variants** - Base, Flutter, Waydroid configurations

## Documentation & Support

ðŸ“š **Comprehensive Documentation**: For detailed documentation, tutorials, and technical guides, visit the [meta-dynamicdevices Wiki](https://github.com/DynamicDevices/meta-dynamicdevices/wiki).

The wiki includes:
- Getting started guides
- Distribution configuration examples
- Build configuration tutorials
- Troubleshooting guides
- Development best practices

## Supported Distributions

### `lmp-dynamicdevices`
Base distribution with core Dynamic Devices features:
- Security hardening (no zeroconf)
- Device auto-registration
- Commercial license support
- Platform-specific optimizations

### `lmp-dynamicdevices-base`
Minimal base distribution for embedded applications

### `lmp-dynamicdevices-flutter`
Distribution with Flutter/Dart runtime support for modern UI applications

### `lmp-dynamicdevices-waydroid`
Distribution with Android container support via Waydroid

## Yocto Project Compatibility

This layer is designed to be **Yocto Project Compatible** and follows distribution layer best practices:

- Contains only distribution-specific configurations
- Does not modify builds unless a supported DISTRO is selected
- Passes `yocto-check-layer` validation as a distro layer
- Compatible with Yocto LTS releases (kirkstone, scarthgap)

## Layer Dependencies

- **meta-lmp-base** - Linux microPlatform base layer
- **meta-openembedded** - OpenEmbedded core layers
- **meta-freescale** - NXP/Freescale BSP support

## Usage

### With KAS Build System

```yaml
header:
  version: 14

distro: lmp-dynamicdevices
machine: imx8mm-jaguar-sentai

repos:
  meta-dynamicdevices-distro:
    path: meta-dynamicdevices-distro
```

### Manual Layer Addition

Add to your `conf/bblayers.conf`:

```
BBLAYERS += "${TOPDIR}/../meta-dynamicdevices-distro"
```

Set in your `conf/local.conf`:

```
DISTRO = "lmp-dynamicdevices"
```
