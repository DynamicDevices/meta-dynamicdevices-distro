# === HEADLESS DEVICE OPTIMIZATION NOTES ===
# This DISTRO is optimized for:
# - E-Ink displays (static, non-interactive)
# - Battery-powered devices (5+ year life)
# - IoT sensors and data loggers
# - Headless servers and gateways
# - Any device without interactive GUI requirements
#
# Benefits:
# - Reduced build time and complexity
# - Lower runtime memory and CPU usage
# - Improved power efficiency
# - Smaller image size
# - Faster boot times
# - Focus on connectivity and core functionality

# === U-BOOT VERSION OVERRIDE ===
# Force u-boot 2024.04 to match working Sentai factory configuration
# Working Sentai uses: u-boot-fio-imx-2024.04
# Previous failing build used: u-boot-fio_imx-2023.04
